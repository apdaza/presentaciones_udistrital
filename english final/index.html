      # Final Project 
      ## Experience of implementing a lesson

      
      - __Activities:__ 
       - review conceptual bases of microservices architecture 
       - review an example implemented in python
      - __Required materials:__
       - Visual Studio Code
       - Docker
       - Internet access
      - __How you felt with your experience:__
        - Working with peers and colleagues (OAS)
        - Preparing the materials and the example
        - [recorded session](https://udistritaleduco-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/apdazac_udistrital_edu_co/EYTwFMrCD1xMiN9_qZfB66sBWdEJieGgBCQqT5UYTD5fZA?e=LTknLs)
        - [the github repo](https://github.com/apdaza/microservices_example.git)
      ???
      - I was working with a few peers and colleagues as far as development experience
      - I try to gather relevant resources that cover the key concepts, principles, and examples of microservices and organize the material in a clear and coherent manner to facilitate understanding keeping in mind that more of them knew something about it.
